# mastermind_game
I built a CLI version of the popular Mastermind/code-breaker game.
The whole thing is in Ruby, and while my OOP still has a ways to go, I'm proud of this project. I should return later to write a proper descriptive README but for now, you can run a demo of the program <a href = "https://replit.com/@Samuelodan/mastermindgame#main.rb">here</a>
